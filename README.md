# Parkinsons Disease Detection using Parkinsons Spiral Drawing
The project aims at predicting whether a person is suffering from Parkinson's Disease or not using Parkinson's Spiral Drawing test.
Prediction is made using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on spiral drawings made by healthy people and people suffering from Parkinson's Disease.


### Dataset
The dataset was taken from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/parkinsons-drawings. The dataset on Kaggle consists of Spiral drawings and Wave Drawings for classfying people
as healthy or having Parkinson's disease. However in this project only Spiral Drawings are used. </br>
The dataset is also present in the 'dataset folder' as seperate '.npz' files for train and test set. </br>
